	<h2>Instructions</h2>
	<h3>Churro Bites</h3>
	<ol>
		<li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
		<li>In a small saucepan over medium heat, bring 2 1/2 tbsp butter, salt, 1/2 tbsp granulated sugar, and water to a boil. Butter should be melted.</li>
		<li>Add flour and quickly whisk until all liquid is absorbed into the flour. Remove saucepan from heat.</li>
		<li>Transfer dough to a stand mixer (or hand mixer + small bowl). Turn mixer speed on high and add egg and vanilla extract to bowl, then beat dough until ingredients are fully incorporated. Dough should be smooth and with a yellow tint.</li>
		<li>Add churro dough to a pastry bag with a large star tip (or use a zip lock bag with the corner cut out). On the parchment covered baking sheet, create small churros that are about an inch wide and 1/4 to 1/2 inch tall. You want the churro dough to be more wide than tall as the churros will puff up significantly while baking. Tips: place something heavy on the parchment paper corners to keep it in place while you work. Hold the pastry bag close to the parchment paper while forming the churro, then quickly lift up the pastry bag up when you're done.</li>
		<li>Bake churro bites for 18-20 minutes or until the ridges of the churros turn golden brown. Remove from oven and let churros cool completely on a wire rack.</li>
		<li>Melt remaining 1 tbsp of butter. Add remaining 1 tbsp of granulated sugar and 1/2 tbsp cinnamon to a large zip lock bag and shake to mix.</li>
		<li>Toss churro bites in melted butter, then add them to the bag with the sugar and cinnamon. Shake the bag until churros are completely covered.</li>
		<li>Set churro bites aside until ice cream boats are done.</li>
	</ol>
	<h3>Ice Cream Boats</h3>
	<ol>
		<li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. In a small bowl, mix together granulated sugar and cinnamon.</li>
		<li>Tortilla taco boats on the baking sheet. Brush the insides with melted butter, then sprinkle with sugar and cinnamon mix.</li>
		<li>Bake in the oven for 8-10 minutes or until insides of taco boats are puffy and lightly browned.</li>
		<li>Scoop vanilla ice cream into taco boats. Sprinkle with churro bites, then drizzle with chocolate. Serve immediately.</li>
